    "##### This Project is part of a multi-part series focused on analyzing and forecasting air quality in Durban using various statistical and machine learning models. In Part 3, we delve into time series analysis and prediction by implementing an AutoRegressive (AR) model on air quality data sourced from MongoDB. Building on the previous parts, where we explored data preprocessing and Linear Regression models, this part will enhance our prediction capabilities by capturing the temporal dependencies in the data.\n",

    "### Context and Goals of this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Def: AutoRegressive (AR) models are a type of statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. They are based on the idea that the current value of a time series can be explained by its own previous values, making them particularly useful for time-dependent data.\n",
    "- Applications of AutoRegressive Models:\n",
    "  1. Economics and Finance: Used for forecasting stock prices, interest rates, and economic indicators.\n",
    "  2. Weather Forecasting: Analyzing temperature and precipitation patterns.\n",
    "  3. Signal Processing: Modeling and predicting audio and speech signals.\n",
    "  4. Engineering: Analyzing and predicting system behaviour over time.\n",
    "- Goals:\n",
    "  1. Data Retrieval: Extract historical air quality data for Durban from a MongoDB database.\n",
    "  2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is suitable for time series analysis.\n",
    "  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the air quality data to identify trends,patterns, and anomalies.\n",
    "  4. AutoRegressive Model Implementation: Implement an AutoRegressive (AR) model to forecast air quality, leveraging the temporal dependencies in the time series data.\n",
    "  5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the AR model using appropriate metrics and compare it with the Linear Regression model implemented in Part 2.\n",
    "  6. Visualization: Visualize the results of the AR model predictions and compare them with the actual air quality data."
